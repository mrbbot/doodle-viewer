# Google Doodle Viewer

As a Chrome user with a custom new tab page, I often miss the Google Doodles when they come out, which is a shame because they can be quite interesting.

This is an app that gets the latest Google Doodle and displays it at the top of your screen. If you click on it, it will take you to the information page. It also won't display another doodle until a new one is released.

I recommend adding this to your list of startup applications, so if there's a new doodle, you'll know about it.
